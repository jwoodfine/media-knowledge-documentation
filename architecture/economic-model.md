A regulated small business sits in a gap. It is too small for an enterprise AI contract — those begin in the hundreds of thousands of dollars a year — and too regulated to run its data through a consumer AI product. Neither sales motion reaches it.

[[pointsav-overview|PointSav]]'s commercial structure is built entirely around that gap. There are two tiers and no Enterprise tier: a free Community tier that is the adoption funnel, and a paid SMB Customer tier for regulated small-to-medium businesses.

The decision is structural, not positional. The target segment runs AI-tooling contracts of roughly 5,000 to 50,000 dollars a year — too small for an enterprise sales motion, too regulated for a consumer product — and the platform's cost structure is designed to serve it profitably.

For a buyer in that segment, the platform's economics are aligned with theirs. This article covers the two tiers, why there is no Enterprise tier, the addressable segment, federation, and the cost asymmetry that protects the position.

## The two commercial tiers, three licenses

Licensing runs per module, not per tier — every crate carries its own SPDX
identifier, and the three real licenses sort into a pattern rather than a clean
two-way split. `os-console` and `os-workplace` (the surfaces a Community deployment
actually runs) are AGPL-3.0-or-later. Most of the rest of the platform — `os-
privategit`, `os-totebox`, `os-mediakit`, `os-infrastructure`, and the `app-
privategit-*`/`app-totebox-*`/`app-mediakit-*` families — carries a Functional
Source License (FSL-1.1-ALv2), which converts to Apache-2.0 after its delay period.
The `app-orchestration-*` family — the commercial inference-routing and federation
core — is fully proprietary, never converting to either open license.

<strong>Community</strong> is the free tier: one [[totebox-os|Totebox OS]] archive and
one [[os-console|ConsoleOS]] terminal, both AGPL, with local model inference as an
optional component. Community is the adoption funnel — it generates contributors and
surfaces edge cases — and [[pointsav-overview|PointSav]] earns no revenue from it.

<strong>SMB Customer</strong> is the revenue tier. It adds the FSL-licensed
distribution surfaces plus the proprietary `app-orchestration-*` core: multi-archive
aggregation, GPU burst capability, federated adapter-marketplace participation, and
priority access to updated base models. The relationship is an Order Form per
customer.

## Why no Enterprise tier

The addressable customer for an Enterprise-tier AI platform typically runs annual contract values above 500,000 dollars. Hyperscale providers are structured for that segment — their sales organisations, compliance certifications, and infrastructure commitments reflect it. [[pointsav-overview|PointSav]] is not equipped to compete there and does not try.

The segment [[pointsav-overview|PointSav]] targets runs annual AI-tooling contract values of 5,000 to 50,000 dollars. That gap — too small for an enterprise motion, too regulated for a consumer product — is structurally inaccessible to a platform built around a hyperscale billing model.

The 2026 market evidence is consistent: GPU pricing at specialist providers runs structurally below hyperscale pricing, a substantial fraction of hyperscale customers report billing unpredictability, and capital-expenditure commitments for AI infrastructure continue to rise. None of these trends help a small business; each raises the pricing floor it faces.

## The addressable SMB segment

Regulated small-to-medium businesses share three properties that define the market.

1. They are too small for an enterprise sales motion at hyperscale minimums.
2. They are too regulated for consumer or unmanaged AI — HIPAA, PIPEDA, GDPR, FINRA, and equivalent Canadian provincial frameworks apply.
3. They require their data and their AI to remain on infrastructure they control.

Examples include small clinics under health-privacy legislation, regional law firms with privilege and confidentiality obligations, mid-cap financial advisors with regulatory reporting requirements, and real-estate operators maintaining corporate document archives. These are not edge cases. They are the mainstream of the regulated economy below the enterprise threshold.

## Federation

Federation capabilities — the federated adapter marketplace, the shared key-value cache pool, and base-model updates — are included in the SMB Customer licence. There is no separate federation tier; every paying customer may participate.

## Continued pretraining as a curatorial investment

[[pointsav-overview|PointSav]]'s investment in continued pretraining of the base model is funded by SMB Customer licence revenue, and the improved base benefits every customer when it ships in the next platform release. The economic structure resembles a Linux distribution: curation is funded by the subscription business, customers run their own installations, and the improved base returns to the full subscriber base.

## The cost asymmetry

The economics that protect this position are straightforward. Adapter fine-tuning of a seven-billion-parameter model costs roughly 30 to 100 dollars per adapter. Continued pretraining of that same model costs 30,000 to 100,000 dollars. Pretraining from scratch at that scale costs 500,000 to 2,000,000 dollars.

A small business can fine-tune adapters on its own data; it cannot fund continued pretraining. [[pointsav-overview|PointSav]] funds the continued pretraining, and federation pools the per-customer adapter learning into a commons that improves the base for everyone. The asymmetry does not depend on any particular competitive outcome — it depends on the economics of compute at scale.

## Service availability by tier

[[three-ring-architecture|Ring 1]] services (boundary ingest) and Ring 2 services (knowledge and processing) are available in both tiers. Ring 3 differs: Community includes optional local model inference; SMB Customer adds GPU burst, external API integration, multi-archive aggregation, federation, and access to updated base models. Support is community-forum only for Community and contracted for SMB Customer.
