This lexicon provides canonical definitions for PointSav platform terms, bridging standard industry vocabulary with the platform's architectural concepts. Each entry defines a term as used in platform documentation, with disambiguation notes and cross-references where relevant. For the [[language-protocol-substrate|language protocol]] that governs which terms are canonical across all three wikis, and for [[editorial-language-registers|register rules]] that govern how terms are translated between audiences, see those articles.

### Record Keeping
*Mantenimiento de Registros*

Function of proprietary software.


## S
<hr>

### Second-party Data
Second-party data is first-party data obtained through a direct partnership agreement; in PointSav, it enters through controlled service-content endpoints with explicit data-sharing contracts recorded in the ledger.

### service-extraction
*service-extraction*

The deterministic parser service. Strips proprietary formatting from inbound payloads and routes structured data to deterministic services and unstructured text to service-slm. Assigns transaction IDs for chain-of-custody tracing. Canonical long-term name replacing the legacy working name service-parser.

### service-materials
*Catálogo de materiales*

A planned, archive-resident service intended to hold the shared catalog of material and building-element identity for use by domain engines such as [[tool-construction|tool-construction]] — classification against the published Uniclass tables, native unit of measure, an optional buildingSMART data dictionary reference, and a content-hash-verified specification citation. `service-materials` never holds cost, price, or productivity data — a citing project's own records reference a catalog row by its content hash, so a later edit to the shared definition is detectable rather than silent, while what a material costs or how productively it installs stays local, contractor-owned data. Proposed; not yet built.

### service-search
*service-search*

The planned inverted-index service for full-text retrieval across the files in a Totebox Archive using Tantivy, designed to operate without a running database engine and to remain searchable on an air-gapped machine. Not yet built — the directory holds a README describing the design, with no crate implementing it.

### Smart Building
*Edificio Inteligente*

A building that uses technology to automatically control its operations, including heating, ventilation, air conditioning, lighting, security, and other systems.

### Surveillance
Monitoring of user activity or system behaviour for security or analytical purposes. PointSav replaces third-party surveillance dependencies with zero-cookie first-party telemetry pipelines.

### System Design
System design is the process of defining the architecture, components, and interfaces of a system to satisfy specified requirements; PointSav's platform design is governed by the [[three-ring-architecture|three-ring-architecture]] and the six-tier sovereignty matrix.


## T
<hr>

### Technofeudalism
A term describing structural dependency on platform providers who control access to data and services. Cited as context for the vendor lock-in problem that PointSav is designed to resolve.

### Third-party Data
Third-party data is collected by an entity with no direct relationship to the end user and sold commercially; PointSav evaluates all third-party data through SYS-ADR-07 and ingests approved datasets via the service-content deterministic pipeline.

### tool-accounting
A flat-file, owner-held domain engine providing double-entry accounting — journals, ledgers, financial statements, and multi-entity consolidation — computed deterministically from plain-text records with no hosted database and git as the audit trail. The platform's original domain engine, and the design pattern sibling `tool-*` engines (including `tool-construction`) are modeled against. Licensed under FSL-1.1-ALv2. See [[tool-accounting|tool-accounting]] for the full article.

### tool-construction
A flat-file, owner-held domain engine providing construction cost, schedule, and quality accountability, built on the same double-entry design discipline as `tool-accounting`. Its central mechanism: installed material quantity, reported once from the field, both earns a labour-hours budget and draws down a material balance in the same transaction — making the relationship between materials and labour structural to the ledger rather than a convention applied on top of it. Licensed under FSL-1.1-ALv2. See [[tool-construction|tool-construction]] for the full article.

### tool-payroll
A proposed, jurisdiction-aware domain engine for gross-to-net pay and statutory remittance timing, designed as a sibling product to `tool-accounting` and fed one-way by `tool-construction` timecards. 100% design as of this writing — no code written, no crate scaffolded. Licensed under FSL-1.1-ALv2. See [[tool-payroll|tool-payroll]] for the full article.

### `tool-*` distribution governance
*(Cross-reference note, not a full entry)*

The platform's distribution governance classifies every `tool-*` directory as internal operator tooling by default, not distributed as a standalone catalog product, with exceptions granted individually — `tool-wallet` is the one existing precedent. No such exception is currently recorded for `tool-accounting`, `tool-construction`, or `tool-payroll`.

### Totebox Archive
*Archivo Totebox*

A self-contained, portable, and encrypted repository for data and applications, designed for long-term storage and secure access. Each Totebox Archive is a single file that can be stored on any storage medium.
