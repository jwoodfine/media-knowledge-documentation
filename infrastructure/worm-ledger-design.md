A regulated firm's records are only as trustworthy as the weakest hand that can reach them. An administrator flag, a software upgrade, a backup restore — any of these can silently alter a historical record. A policy that promises they will not is not the same as a structure that does not let them.

PointSav's [[three-ring-architecture|Ring 1 services]] persist every boundary record — filesystem, people data, email, structured input — to a Write-Once-Read-Many ledger via [[service-fs|the service-fs substrate]]. Each record's hash chains into the one before it, so altering any past entry changes every hash after it — a property that already holds today, on top of a flat per-tenant append log (`log.jsonl`). The ledger is **designed to adopt** the C2SP tlog-tiles transparency-log format as its on-disk layout; that tile segmentation is the one piece still ahead of the current implementation.

The ledger is **designed as four layers** — tile storage, a WORM API, a wire protocol, and recurring anchoring of signed checkpoints to a public transparency log. Immutability is a property of the storage substrate, not of operational policy.

For a regulated buyer the consequence is concrete. One architecture satisfies three recordkeeping regimes at once — US broker-dealer rules under SEC Rule 17a-4(f), EU qualified preservation under eIDAS, and the SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria — and an external auditor can verify any record without the platform operator's cooperation.

## The four-layer stack

The ledger is built in four layers.

**Layer 1 — tile storage.** The storage architecture **specifies** the C2SP tlog-tiles specification [^1] — the same tile format used internally by Trillian-Tessera and externally by Sigstore Rekor v2 [^2] — as the target storage primitive. The current `service-fs` implementation persists a per-tenant JSON append log pending the tile backend. When the tile format is implemented, every tile the platform writes will be verifiable by any tool in the transparency-log ecosystem, with no format conversion.

**Layer 2 — WORM ledger API.** The ledger trait's five operations — open a ledger for a tenant, append a payload and receive a cursor, read entries since a cursor, produce a signed checkpoint [^3], and verify inclusion and consistency proofs — are all implemented today. The shipping `service-fs` exposes `POST /v1/append`, `GET /v1/entries`, `GET /v1/checkpoint`, `GET /v1/contract`, `GET /healthz`, and `GET /readyz` over HTTP, plus an MCP endpoint. The production backend, `PosixTileLedger`, writes to a flat per-tenant `log.jsonl` file today — real tile segmentation, the eventual C2SP-format on-disk layout, is what's still pending.

**Layer 3 — wire protocol.** An HTTP service layer exposes the ledger API over the network, with the MCP server protocol — the 2026 standard for tool-bearing AI services — layered on top. The same wire shape runs on a standard Linux daemon and on a seL4 Microkit unikernel; the execution envelope changes, the protocol does not.

**Layer 4 — anchoring.** Signed checkpoints are published monthly to Sigstore Rekor [^2] by a dedicated anchor-emitter client, which fetches the current checkpoint, submits it as a hashedRekord entry, and appends the resulting Rekor entry back to the ledger — a systemd timer drives the monthly cadence. This runs today; a third-party auditor can already confirm a record's integrity against the public log without involving the platform operator.

## How immutability is enforced structurally

The POSIX filesystem implementation follows a four-step write pattern: write the tile bytes to a temporary file, call `fsync` to commit to disk, rename atomically to the canonical tile path, and set the file mode to read-only. The hash-chain structure of the tile format means any modification to a written tile changes the chain — the next tile's recorded hash of the previous tile no longer matches. Modification is detectable without a separate audit log.

Filesystem journal mode adds a second layer. A deployment running in a hardened systemd environment may also set the Linux immutable flag on tile files, which requires an operating-system capability to remove. This is defence-in-depth, not a requirement of the current production baseline.

## Per-tenant structure

Every ledger is bound to a `moduleId` — a tenant identifier the wire layer enforces on every API call. A request whose `moduleId` does not match the open ledger is rejected. Tile files are stored under a per-tenant path, and per-tenant signing keys produce per-tenant signed checkpoints.

An auditor inspecting one tenant's ledger therefore need not trust that the vendor maintained separation between tenants. The cryptographic structure makes the separation verifiable.

## Compliance mapping

**SEC Rule 17a-4(f)** requires records to be preserved in a non-rewriteable, non-erasable format with verifiable timestamps and an independent third-party verification capability. The current flat-file format satisfies the non-rewriteable property structurally today, ahead of the tile format's own eventual segmentation. Each signed checkpoint carries a timestamp under the per-tenant signing key. Monthly publication to the Rekor transparency log runs today, supplying third-party verification that does not need the operator's cooperation.

**EU qualified preservation under eIDAS** requires long-term preservation independent of future technological change, integrity preservation, and authentication of the originator. The ledger carries an explicit hash-algorithm field in each checkpoint, so migrating to a different hash function is a per-tenant decision that does not require rewriting historical tiles. The tile format is an open specification — RFC 9162 [^4] and C2SP — readable with standard tools that remain available regardless of future commercial software. Integrity and originator authentication use the same mechanisms as the SEC mapping.

**SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria.** Logical access control is enforced at the wire layer by per-tenant `moduleId` validation. Change management is covered by the audit sub-ledger — a separate ledger instance that records every read and write to the primary ledger, itself a WORM record. Processing integrity rests on the hash chain and the public anchor.

## Dual anchoring and customer sovereignty

A customer's Totebox OS deployment runs its own ledger instances with its own signing keys. The customer is the subject of its own records and holds the signing key that attests them. The vendor workspace independently anchors the same tile checkpoints, giving redundant verifiability; the customer can remove the vendor from the anchoring arrangement at any time, and the integrity guarantee does not depend on vendor participation.

This property — customer key sovereignty with optional vendor redundancy — is not something a managed cloud service can offer. A managed cloud service is architecturally the custodian of both the data and the signing key.

## Implementation state

The `service-fs` Ring 1 service implements the full WORM ledger substrate in production: append, entries, checkpoint, contract, health, and readiness over HTTP, plus checkpoint signing, inclusion proofs, and consistency proofs at the ledger-trait level. Each appended record carries a per-payload SHA-256 digest, chained into the running ledger hash. Monthly Rekor anchoring of production checkpoints runs today via a dedicated anchor-emitter client on a systemd timer. What remains ahead of the design's own stated target is the storage format itself: `PosixTileLedger` currently persists to a flat per-tenant `log.jsonl` file, not yet segmented into genuine C2SP tiles.
