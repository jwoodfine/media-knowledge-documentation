The WORM ledger storage architecture describes how the [[worm-ledger-design|platform’s immutable ledger]] persists data to disk — and why the specific format and write discipline matter for long-term regulatory compliance. The storage layer **specifies** the C2SP tlog-tiles specification as its target primitive per the [[worm-ledger-architecture|four-layer ledger architecture]]. The current `service-fs` implementation persists records as a newline-delimited JSON append log (`log.jsonl`) with per-payload SHA-256 digests, pending the tile backend.

## 1. The tile-based storage engine

The storage architecture **specifies** the **C2SP tlog-tiles** format as its target storage primitive. This format, used by Sigstore Rekor and Google’s Certificate Transparency, breaks a Merkle tree into static, append-only files (tiles). The tile backend is planned and not yet implemented; the current deployment uses a per-tenant JSON append log.

* **Atomic Durability (current):** Records are written to a temporary file, synchronised with `fsync`, and renamed atomically to the canonical path. This ensures that partial writes never corrupt the ledger state.
* **Plain-Text Transparency (planned):** Under the target tile format, tiles are stored as newline-delimited base64 text, inspectable using standard Unix utilities (`cat`, `base64`, `sha256sum`).
* **Chain-Based Integrity (current), Merkle Tree (planned):** Every entry's hash chains into the one before it, and `service-fs` already serves real inclusion and consistency proofs against that chain today — recomputing the relevant chain segment and checking it against a signed checkpoint's recorded root hash. What the design targets and doesn't yet have is a true branching Merkle tree, which would make a proof's size independent of how far back the entry sits rather than scaling with the chain segment length.

## 2. Dual-target runtime envelopes

The architecture is designed to support two distinct operational environments using the same codebase:

### Envelope A: Hosted Daemon (Current)
Running as a standard Linux/BSD process, `service-fs` uses POSIX file I/O for storage. Per-tenant isolation is enforced through separate process address spaces and strict filesystem permissions.

### Envelope B: seL4 Unikernel (Intended)
The long-term trajectory involves deploying `service-fs` as an seL4 Microkit Protection Domain. In this envelope, storage is mediated by `moonshot-database` (PSDB), where access is governed by formally verified microkernel capabilities.

## 3. Cryptographic and compliance alignment

The storage engine is engineered to satisfy strict regulatory requirements:
* **SEC 17a-4(f):** Satisfies the "WORM path" by structurally denying modification at the storage layer.
* **eIDAS Qualified Preservation:** Ensures 100-year readability through open-standard plain-text encodings and algorithm-agile hash functions.
* **SOC 2 Processing Integrity (audit-ready, not yet certified):** the design provides verifiable audit trails through a dedicated sub-ledger that records every read event — the underlying controls are in place, but no SOC 2 Type 2 audit has been performed and no attestation has been issued.

## 4. Portability and sovereignty

The tile-based logs are portable, open-standard, and self-verifying across any hardware — from a virtual machine running as a Linux daemon today to an seL4-hardened Totebox OS appliance in a future deployment. No proprietary hardware and no specific cloud vendor is required to verify or restore the ledger.
