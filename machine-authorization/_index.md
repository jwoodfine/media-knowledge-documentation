**Machine authorization** covers the credential and admission mechanisms that gate who and what can act on the platform — pairing a device onto the WireGuard mesh, issuing and rotating the Ed25519 capability tokens services use to authenticate to each other, enrolling a compute node into a fleet, and authenticating a signed binary download. These are genuinely separate mechanisms, not one system under different names; each guide states plainly where its own mechanism's real limits are, including where no revocation or un-pairing command exists today.

<!-- START-HERE-HIGHLIGHT: engine reads this block to render the single "start here" card
     (reuses the existing cluster-card--start-here component). Do not add more than one. -->

**Start here:** [[pair-a-new-device|Pair a new device]] — registers a device with the pairing server and walks through administrator approval, the most common entry point into this category.

## Pairing and tokens

<!-- AUTO-GENERATED MEMBERSHIP: DO NOT EDIT BELOW — regenerate from index_group: pairing-and-tokens -->
- [[pair-a-new-device|Pair a new device]] — Pairs an unpaired os-console device onto the PPN mesh: read the pairing code from the startup screen, have an administrator approve it, and confirm network admission.
- [[issue-capability-token|Issue a capability token]] — Issues an Ed25519-signed pairing token from service-content over plain HTTP, registers it with the receiving peer, and covers the separate X-Foundry-Capability request header.
- [[rotate-keys|Rotate keys and capability tokens]] — Replaces a service-content credential within the real system's limits: tokens expire on a fixed 24-hour clock, overlap is unavoidable, and no mechanism cuts a live token short.
<!-- END AUTO-GENERATED -->

## Fleet enrollment

<!-- AUTO-GENERATED MEMBERSHIP: DO NOT EDIT BELOW — regenerate from index_group: fleet-enrollment -->
- [[enroll-ppn-node|Enroll a PPN node]] — Enrolls a machine into a PPN compute fleet by setting service-vm-host's three required environment variables, running it under systemd, and confirming the node in the controller listing.
<!-- END AUTO-GENERATED -->

## Software distribution

<!-- AUTO-GENERATED MEMBERSHIP: DO NOT EDIT BELOW — regenerate from index_group: software-distribution -->
- [[authenticate-binary-downloads|Authenticate binary downloads]] — Authenticates a release from software.pointsav.com: confirm the on-chain order, follow the download link that mints an Ed25519 token, and understand where verification actually happens.
<!-- END AUTO-GENERATED -->

Each guide carries its own prerequisites, verification steps, and rollback procedure; this
page doesn't repeat them. Day-to-day operation of a running deployment is in
[Platform Tasks](/category/how-to).
